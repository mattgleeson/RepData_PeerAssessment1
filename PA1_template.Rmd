steps_activity <- na.omit(raw_activity)
head(steps_activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps_activity$steps, list(date = steps_activity$date), sum)
head(steps_by_day)
mean(steps_by_day$x)
median(steps_by_day$x)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
